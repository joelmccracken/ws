#+title: Readme


setting up
- download ws_install.sh and run, optionally setting env vars to customize
  - sets up repo
  - makes various default files etc, esp settings.sh
  - maybe use a different dir as source?
- customize ws_profile/settings.sh (where should this go?)
   can run gen



e.g. download ws_install and run
download personal workstation configuration, or put in place in some other way
run e.g. workstation bootstrap


setup steps
configure any env vars if want installed elsewhere
curl ws_install, run it w bash
execute ws bootstrap ()
- at this point, where should configurations be?
implement a -i or -q for interactive/quiet? (-i default?)
where should the settings and config file be located?
* ideas/TODO
- TODO make actual modification commands clearer/explicitly logged.
- automatic adding of ws tool's bin dir to PATH, at least, and perhaps
  other relevant tasks?
- automatically/better handle conflicts when e.g. replacing a file/dir with a ws
  managed version that already exists?
  - good idea to log, "save" these differences in state
- command like `ws hack` that loads all of the relevant workstation stuff into
  an interactive bash session and drops the user in it so they can
  experiment/make whatever changes are necessary.
- finish porting remaining functionality from workstation repo to this (ws)
  - home manager
  - bww/secrets
  - df/dotfiles subcommand
  - standardized/better logging/output
    - save logs in a subdir?
    - save state/info somewhere?
      - "last checked on $date, properties verified ..."
      - ran the following potentially destructive commands,
        making the differences/changes noted in <some diff>
      - save md5 hashes of previous runs/files so it can know
        that nothing has changed in a file since a previous run, and so it can
        safely overwrite/remove whatever necessary changes.
- better docs/explanation of how it all works
- parameterizable properties?
  - vs just wanting props to wrap?
  - oo commands to props, e.g. so that prop_foo takes a --fix flag
    and then a separate function is not needed? makes some things simpler
    - also does expand upon the notion of functions as way to indirectly trigger
      or control behavior, like how the dotfiles mgmt system works.
- collect/predefine descriptionm of what changes would be made as detailed as
  possible before actually invoking?
  - the "print the fix function" is pretty useless, fix funcs too complex
    - replace with "drop into shell here" command, similar to the `ws hack`
      suggestion above?
- build a single ws bin that can be thus distributed
  - cat most of the files together should work
  - avoids much of the initial difficulty
    - no need to clone/fetch entire repo
    - ws_install can be replaced with a curl that just downloads the ws tool
    - no need for WORKSTATION_DIR to house files etc
  - makes sense with XDG_BASE_DIRECTORY spec:
    - .local/state/ws for logs, saving state
      - XDG_STATE_HOME
  - store ws bin itself in .local/bin
    - havintg just one bin would remove a lot of the unknowns with issues
  - thinking about things that work in this direction anyway, like
    generating default config files from code instead of
